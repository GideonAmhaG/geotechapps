<p>As a Civil Engineer, I have always been interested in designing and building structures that are both functional and beautiful. However, I found that there were few tools available that could help me design different types of building foundations quickly and easily. That's why I decided to create this web tool.</p>

<p>My goal with this project was to create a tool that would make it easy for other engineers and architects to design building foundations without having to spend hours doing calculations by hand. I wanted to create something that was both powerful and easy to use.</p>
